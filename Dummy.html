        <p><h2>Here are some other things you need to know about Santan:</h2></p>
        <h3>1) He listens to a lot of film soundtracks</h3>
        <p>"I've always had a different ear for music, I really enjoy Lana Del Rey and Pink Floyd", he told Vice in 2016. "I've always listened to 
            different styles of music to make sure I'm balanced. I feel like if you only listen to your music you can never go outside of it."
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>2) Dave's mum didn't approve his career choices</h3>
        <center><img src = "davemum1.jpg" width="500"></center>
        <p>
            Dave was still a student when his first track exploded on YouTube - so his mum didn't appreciate him cancelling a degree in Law to pursue music. But she was won around eventually, 
            joining her youngest son son stage at the Hammersmith Apollo as he picked up his Mercury Prize September 2020.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>3) His track Black has caused a lot of controversy</h3>
        <p>
            The lead single off his album "Psychodrama" focuses on the perception of black people in Britain. When it was played on BBC Radio 1, the song provoked complaints from a 
            small minority of listeners who said it was "racist among white people". For his performance at the Brits, he added a new verse describing the Prime Minister, Boris John 
            as racist. This fueled a lot of discussions among people.
